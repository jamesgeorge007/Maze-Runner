<h1 align="center"> Maze-Runner </h1>

## Basic Info 

This is basically an interactive maze runner game built using the Pygame module available in the python programming language which is an open source library used to build 2-D games. What I tried is to clone the T-Rex game available offline in the Google Chrome web browser. 

> Made for the Windows platform.
